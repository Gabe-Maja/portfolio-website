# (Post MVP) Prompt changes v2

### General

1. Can we have the Projects Section and Contact Section a gradient shade of the color hex code of `#3a4f47` (optimized for viewer experience)

### Home / Hero Section

1. Please remove `to Transform Data` highlighted in green. Keep everything else the same.

### About Section

1. Lower my head in the display picture sightly more. (i.e - give some “breathing room” from top of my head to image border)
2. Can we have the Hard Skills, Soft Skills and Industry Experience tiles change to a gradient shade of the color hex code of `#3a4f47` (optimized for viewer experience). Ensure that actual skills and Headings are contrasted well against the new tile shade. Lastly, change actual hard skill tags to a hex colour code of `#231f20` . Then change the actual text for the Hard Skills to white. In all this, ensure the contrast for all tiles is optimized.
3. Lets edit `What Sets Gabe Apart` section. Change to EXACTLY this:
    
    ```
    Gabe is at the forefront of AI automation, actively building agent-based systems that transform repetitive business processes into streamlined workflows. His hands-on approach to AI development goes beyond theory - he's currently deploying agentic workflows that achieve ~90% time reduction in complex, multi-step processes.
    
    Why this matters to your business:
    Most business workflows contain repetitive elements that can be automated through AI agents. Gabe has developed the competence to identify these automation opportunities and build custom AI solutions that deliver measurable efficiency gains. While others discuss AI potential, Gabe engineers working systems that eliminate manual bottlenecks and scale operations without additional headcount.
    
    This AI-first mindset means he doesn't just analyze your data - he builds intelligent systems that continuously optimize your business processes.
