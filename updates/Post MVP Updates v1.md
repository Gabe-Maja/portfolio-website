# (Post MVP) Changes Prompt v1

Lets chat about some changes I want:

### Header Section

1. Change ‘Gabriel Maja’ to ‘Gabriel Kevin Maja’

### Home / Hero Section

1. The dynamic wording in the Hero/Home section is wrong. I want it in this way:
Levering Artificial Intelligence to Transform Data …- - Levering Business Intelligence to Transform Data … - - Levering Data Science to Transform Data … (and loop in this manner and in this order)

### About Section

1. My display picture has my head cropped out. please fix this by ensuring my face is not cropped out (face is more centered)
2. Change “**About Gabe”** to **“About Gabriel Kevin Maja (Gabe)”**
3. Can we have the Hard Skills, Soft Skills and Industry Experience tiles have some sort of shade of gradient grey (optimized for viewer experience)
4. Lets edit `What Sets Gabe Apart` section. Change this to…
    
    ```
    Gabe is at the forefront of AI automation, actively building agent-based systems that transform repetitive business processes into streamlined workflows. His hands-on approach to AI development goes beyond theory - he's currently deploying agentic workflows that achieve ~90% time reduction in complex, multi-step processes.
    
    Why this matters to your business:
    Most business workflows contain repetitive elements that can be automated through AI agents. Gabe has developed the competence to identify these automation opportunities and build custom AI solutions that deliver measurable efficiency gains. While others discuss AI potential, Gabe engineers working systems that eliminate manual bottlenecks and scale operations without additional headcount.
    
    This AI-first mindset means he doesn't just analyze your data - he builds intelligent systems that continuously optimize your business processes.
    ```
    
    1. Hard Skills: 
        1. Takeout “**AI & Automation” and** Add “AI Agents” + “Process Automation”
        
    
    ### Projects Section.
    
    1. The current layout is perfect. However I want a “Take a Deeper Dive” clickable feint button (at the bottom of each project just under Tech Stack) that redirects the end user to learn more about the project. This section must then contain all elements from the project files in GitHub. “Take a Deeper Dive” button must be be similar to ‘LinkedIn Profile’ button in testimonials section.
    
    ### General
    
    Can we have the Projects Section and Contact Section some sort of shade of gradient grey (optimized for viewer experience) - - same shade as skills tiles in About Section
